## Description 

This is an appication that was made so that it follows accessibilty standards and it is optimized for search engines. 


- my motivation behind this is that you are able to make an application for all to see, and its my first ever project. 
- i built this project because it was asked that we meet accessibility standards.
- it solves the problem that for different viewers of the webpage so that every one will be able to see this page.
- i learned that you can build a webpage with semantic elements and non semantic elements and how they can differ.

## Usage

this website's intended use was to meet accessibility standards, so i had cleaned up the code and added alt tags so if a guest visiting the website cant see the images on the page, they can see a description of the image.
This is the deployed webpage of the site.
